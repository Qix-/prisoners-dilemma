# Prisoners Dilemma

A [prisoner's dilemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner%27s_dilemma)
simulator written in C. Intended to be as fast as possible.

Thanks to [Robert Sapolsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Sapolsky)
for being a badass and a great professor, piquing my interest in this stuff.

Compile with [tup](http://gittup.org/tup), run with no arguments to see usage.

If you're debugging new strategies, set `VERBOSITY` to `2` in main.c. Note this
kills performance. :+1:

**I want your strategy pull requests.**
